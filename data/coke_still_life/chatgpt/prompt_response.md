### Objects List

1. **Coca-Cola Bottle**
   - **Name**: Coca-Cola Bottle
   - **Brief Description**: A classic glass bottle of Coca-Cola, filled with dark cola liquid, labeled with the iconic red Coca-Cola branding.
   - **Stable Diffusion Description**: Create an image of a classic glass bottle of Coca-Cola. The bottle should be filled with dark cola liquid and have a red label with the Coca-Cola logo prominently displayed.
   - **Text-to-3D Description**: Model a classic glass bottle of Coca-Cola. The bottle should be filled with dark cola liquid, have a red label with the Coca-Cola logo, and a red cap. Ensure the bottle has a vintage, slightly curved shape with the familiar texture and contours of a Coca-Cola glass bottle.

2. **Tuna Melt Sandwich**
   - **Name**: Tuna Melt Sandwich
   - **Brief Description**: A grilled sandwich cut in half, filled with tuna salad, melted cheese, and possibly some slices of vegetables like pickles or tomatoes. It is placed on a wooden cutting board.
   - **Stable Diffusion Description**: Create an image of a grilled tuna melt sandwich cut in half, showing the filling of tuna salad, melted cheese, and slices of vegetables such as pickles or tomatoes. The bread should be golden brown with grill marks, and the sandwich should be placed on a rustic wooden cutting board.
   - **Text-to-3D Description**: Model a grilled tuna melt sandwich cut diagonally in half. The filling should include tuna salad, melted cheese, and slices of vegetables such as pickles or tomatoes. The bread should have a golden brown color with visible grill marks. Place the sandwich halves on a rustic wooden cutting board.

3. **Wooden Cutting Board**
   - **Name**: Wooden Cutting Board
   - **Brief Description**: A rustic wooden cutting board with a handle, used as a serving platter for the sandwich.
   - **Stable Diffusion Description**: Create an image of a rustic wooden cutting board with a handle. The board should have a natural wood grain texture and look slightly worn to emphasize its rustic quality. It can be used as a serving platter for food items like sandwiches.
   - **Text-to-3D Description**: Model a rustic wooden cutting board with a handle. The board should have a natural wood grain texture, slight wear and tear to emphasize its rustic appearance, and be of medium size suitable for serving a sandwich.

4. **Wooden Table**
   - **Name**: Wooden Table
   - **Brief Description**: A wooden table with a rough, rustic texture, used as the base surface for both the Coca-Cola bottle and the wooden cutting board with the sandwich.
